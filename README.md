## A Bi-LSTM-CRF Chinese Named Entity Recognition Platform in Tensorflow
A Bi-LSTM-CRF Chinese NER Platform in **Tensorflow**.  
The basic NER model is based on [ChineseNER](https://github.com/zjy-ucas/ChineseNER)

## Major Features
1. stat-of-art performance in NER task
2. a service deploy module    *TBD*

## Improvements
1. Add more features (POS, n-gram)    *TBD*
2. Add TensorBoard to visualize the training process    *TBD*
3. Add service deploy module    *TBD*
4. Add a website interface for users    *TBD*
5. Build a integrated Chinese NER system, combined with CRF and Dictionary-base methods    *TBD*

## Requirements
[Tensorflow=1.2.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)  
[jieba=0.37](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) 

## Basic Usage
TBD
